    <p>Our project was inspired by the desire to increase understanding between politicians and their constituents. We want to ensure that constituents know how their politicians are voting on specific issues. Our team also wants politicians to be able to see a more generalized view of what their constituents want their politicians to be voting for.  Therefore, our team built Votify to allow users to get this information. On our web platform, users will be able to see a clear and concise view of how politicians in Seattle have been voting. </p>
