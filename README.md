Project Description
-------------------

Votify aims to fill in the information gap between Washington state government and its voters. Specifically, we aimed to provide these voters an easy opportunity to view information on state legislature, communicate their viewpoints to their legislators, and track how their legislatorsâ€™ voting records matched their thoughts and concerns on issues. Our application utilizes the legislative data from www.leg.wa.gov to display to users pertinent information regarding bills and the roll call voting record per legislation. Votify aims to provide a streamlined user interface focused on local issues that will more directly affect its users.
